 1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
SPEAKER 1: Can I ask you to tell the story

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,000
SPEAKER 1: that you told about Bon Appetit magazine?

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,000
SPEAKER 2: I'm here to talk about you!

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
SPEAKER 1: So, the Bon Appetit magazine is in my new special,

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
SPEAKER 1 : the old man in the pool.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
SPEAKER 1: No, it's a... Can you tell that story,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,000
SPEAKER 1: or you don't want to tell it?

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,000
SPEAKER 2: Sure, I can tell it. I mean, it's a long story.

9
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,000
SPEAKER 2: We'll have to probably cut it out of the show.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,000
SPEAKER 2: I don't know, but I was just telling this story that...

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
SPEAKER 1: I love this story.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,000
SPEAKER 1: They cut it out, they cut it out.

13
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
SPEAKER 2: My mom was a very, very funny person,

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:33,000
SPEAKER 2: and she would call me up, and, like,

15
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
SPEAKER 2: she would say something to either annoy me

16
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,000
SPEAKER 2: or something like that, and I go,

17
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,000
SPEAKER 2: all right, Mom, I can't take it anymore.

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
SPEAKER 2: I got to hang up. She'd go, don't hang up.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
SPEAKER 2: Wait, wait, one more thing. You know, whatever.
